# Laravel Gitpod Starter

This repository can be used as a copy master to set up a new Laravel application running on Gitpod. It contains additional files and settings so it works fine with Gitpods pre-builds.

Just create a new project from Gitpod, select your repo and start a new workspace. I suggest to wait till your first pre-build has been finished before you start a new workspace.
